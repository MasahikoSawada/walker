# Walw

A pluggable background worker walking through WAL records for PostgreSQL.

# Usage

## Installation
Since Walw requires PostgreSQL source codes to build please download PostgreSQL source code from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source/). The walw support PostgreSQL 10.0 or highe

1. Extract PostgreSQL source code and go to contrib/ directory

```bash
$ tar zxf postgresql-10.1.tar.bz2
$ cd postgresql-10.1/contrib
```

1. git clone walw repositry and build

```bash
$ git clone
$ make
$ su
# make install
```

## Setting
Walw provide only one GUC parameter `walw.plugins`. Setting comma-separated plugins list to `walw.plugins` to postgresql.conf

```bash
$ vim /path/to/postgresql.conf
shared_preload_libraries = 'walw'
walw.plugins = 'heatmap'
```
# Walw Plugins

## Initialize function
An Walw plugin is loaded by dinamically loading a shared library with the plugin's name as the library base name.  The normal library search path is used to locate the library. To provide the required output plugin callbacks and to indicate that the library is actually an output plugin it needs to provide a function named `_PG_walw_plugin_init`. This function is passed a struct that needs to be filled with the callback function pointers for individual actions.

```c
typedef struct WalwCallbacks
{
	WalwCallbackHeap_cb	heap_cb;
	WalwCallbackHeap2_cb	heap2_cb;
} WalwCallbacks;

typedef void (*WalwPluginInit) (struct WalwCallbacks *cb);
```

All callbacked are required.

## Walw Plugin Callbacks
The all callback functions are called whenever walw background worker read WAL record. Walw identifies the WAL record and dispatches it to appropriate callbacks. If multiple plugins are specified, each callbacks is called in same order as setting.

### Callback for RM_HEAP_ID

```c
typedef void (*WalwCallbackHeap_cb) (XLogReaderState *record);
```

### Callback for RM_HEAP2_ID

```c
typedef void (*WalwCallbackHeap2_cb) (XLogReaderState *record);
```

# FAQ
* Is the walw same as logical decoding plugin?
  * No. The Logical decoding plugins cannot retrieve WALs of wihch correponding transaction is rollbacked or aborted. Also, logical decoding plugin's function are invoked at commit of the transaction. On the other hand, walw simply read through all WAL record including both aborted record and committed record.
* What can we use walw for?
  * The walw repository has a sample plugin called `heatmap`. This plugin collect gerbage information of all heap and generate heat map which helps us to reclaim garbage more effeciency. Also, I think walw can be used for something like incremental backup.
